You can use the environments based on the requirements.txt files to run everything in this folder.
However since this folder is for small, separate files, they're small enough that if you just want 
to test these and nothing else, it's easier to just install everything in their respective imports 
sections.

For further details on using the environments.txt files, see the other readmes.
