NOTE: Required downloads: 
UpdatedPub150.csv from https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/WPI 
code-list_csv.csv from https://datahub.io/core/un-locode
Make sure you're in the Map Data/Ports directory, 
or adjust their paths in Digitraffic_To_SQLite_functions.py

Also note that fishing vessels are not found in the AIS data as per EU regulations, 
see discussion here: https://groups.google.com/g/meridigitrafficfi/c/4SVoBmZgFbM/m/tBnbU9eABgAJ

The glider popup graphs can be controlled with click-drag, scroll-zoom and reset with double-click.

When clicking a ship, its range, previous path and predicted path will be shown.
The range circle can be removed by double-clicking it.

The necessary packages can be installed in your active python environment using the map_requirements.txt file:
pip install -r map_requirements.txt

Alternatively you can create a new environment, potentially for new features or fixes to the packages
(such as when this project was originally created, the compatible version of Folium had a bugged measurement tool).

To create a conda environment capable of running all the script files, use the following commands:
conda create -n your_env_name_here
conda activate your_env_name_here
conda config --env --add channels conda-forge
conda config --env --set channel_priority strict
conda install python=3 geopandas altair

For the notebooks you'll also need:
pip install ipykernel ipynb

initialize_ais_database.py
    Run to initialize the SQLite database: gets ALL possible metadata (since 2018-01-01)
    and location data from given timestamp (datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=12, minutes=0)).
    Should only be ran once when creating the database - 
    initializing more than once should not cause errors, but is a waste of resources.

    Parameters to edit:
        latitude, longitude, distance, since
        - Determine where and when to get location data from

        initialization_timestamp
        - Determines the time where metadata initialized from (2018-01-01 contains all as of 2023).
          Necessary due to potentially having an old ship without updated metadata appearing 
          and forcing constant updates in draw_map. Therefore not recommended to edit.

        database
        - Name of the SQLite file. Remember to change in all other scripts as well!
    
    Call arguments:
        .../your_env_name_here/bin/python 
        .../initialize_ais_database.py 
        since_hrs 
        database

    Example call:
    .../your_env_name_here/bin/python ".../FMI Gliders/AIS Map/Map Scripts/initialize_ais_database.py" 12 ".../FMI Gliders/AIS Map/Map Data/AIS.sqlite"

update_meta.py
    Run to update the metadata table ("meta") in the database. Recommend e.g. every 6hrs.
    Automatically finds when last update was made and finds changes since then.
    Updates values for MMSIs already in the database and adds new rows for those that aren't.
        Contains commented out code for appending everything instead, but this is untested and 
    likely to break things, so not recommended - you should at least save to a table other than
    "meta" if you use this feature.

    Parameters to edit:
        database
        - Name of the SQLite file. Remember to change in all other scripts as well!

    Call arguments:
        .../your_env_name_here/bin/python 
        .../update_meta.py 
        database

    Example call:
    .../your_env_name_here/bin/python ".../FMI Gliders/AIS Map/Map Scripts/update_meta.py" ".../FMI Gliders/AIS Map/Map Data/AIS.sqlite"

update_locations.py
    Run to update the locations table ("locations") in the database, delete sufficiently old location data 
    from the database, draw a new map and update the "meta" table as well if any MMSIs in "locations" 
    aren't found in "meta". Recommend e.g. every hour or 30 mins. New values in "locations" are simply 
    appended and the previous map is simply replaced.

    Parameters to edit:
        latitude, longitude, distance, since
        - Determine where and when to get location data from, recommend "since" to be slightly higher than
          update interval (e.g. if update_locations.py run every hour, since = datetime.now() - timedelta(hours=1, minutes=30))

        time_cutoff_dt
        - Determines how old data should be discarded from the "locations" table.

        map_longitude, map_latitude, map_center
        - Determine where the map defaults to when first loaded. 
          If there are glider locations known, should default to latest of those instead however.

        database
        - Name of the SQLite file. Remember to change in all other scripts as well!

        vip_ships
        - Specific ships to classify outside normal classification (e.g. Aranda). Remember to change update_threats.py to use them as well!
        
        root_dir, map_filename
        - Directory and filename to save the map to. Remember to change update_threats.py to use them as well!
    
    Call arguments:
        .../your_env_name_here/bin/python 
        .../update_locations.py
        since_hrs

update_threats.py
    Run to update the locations of sufficiently recent threats in the "locations" table and draw a new map.
    If there are no sufficiently recent threats, do nothing instead. Recommend every 10 mins or so. New values 
    in "locations" are simply appended and the previous map is simply replaced. Makes an API call for each MMSI 
    individually which can be slow, so let's hope there aren't ever a lot at once!

    Parameters to edit:
        recency_cutoff
        - Determines how old threats should be ignored. Recommend slightly higher than script run interval
          (e.g. if update_threats.py run every 10 mins, recency_cutoff = datetime.now() - timedelta(minutes=15))

        latitude, longitude, distance, since
        - Determine where and when to get location data from, recommend to match update_locations.py.

        map_longitude, map_latitude, map_center
        - Determine where the map defaults to when first loaded. 
          If there are glider locations known, should default to latest of those instead however.

        database
        - Name of the SQLite file. Remember to change in all other scripts as well!

Digitraffic_To_SQLite_functions.py
    Contains the functions necessary for performing the Digitraffic API calls, processing the data and saving it into
    the database ("locations" and "meta" tables).

              Suggested format of {'Digitraffic-User': 'Your-username-here/Your-projectname-here'}
              Donâ€™t send any PII (personally identifiable information) via the headers!

        manual_coordinate_updates()
        manual_port_additions()

Draw_Map_functions.py
    Contains the functions necessary for loading data from the database, updating it if necessary, processing it for 
    map drawing, drawing the map and saving data of any ships classified as threats (load from "locations" and "meta",
    update "meta", save to "threats"). Also uses some functions from Digitraffic_To_SQLite_functions.py.
        If there are no active gliders, an IOError message will be printed and the map will only have the ships categorized 
    by the region they are in. This is done because drawing all ship markers at once is bad for performance - with the 
    category layers you can look at just the regions that interest you.
        Note: every script that checks for missing metadata using check_missing_meta function will print a message if there's
              still missing metadata after updating (i.e. "Some metadata still missing after update, try again later")

    After a glider mission ends and it has been retrieved, this script can remove all now unnecessary data from that mission.
    First edit the following parameters in main():

        glider
            - The name of the glider whose mission ended (in lowercase)
        mission_end
            - The datetime for the end of the mission/glider retrieval

    If necessary also edit:
        database
            - The filepath to the sqlite database with the relevant "threats" table
        json_root
            - The filepath to the directory with the json files you want to edit
        archive_root
            - The filepath to the directory with the goto and yo files

    Also edit the json file names in the read_json_remove_glider() calls in main() if necessary.

    Then call the script with e.g.:
    /opt/usr/local/anaconda3/envs/AIS_maps/bin/python $HOME/src/glider/AIS_map/mission_end_cleanup.py
